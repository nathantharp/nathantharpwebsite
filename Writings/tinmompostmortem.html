			<h1 class="name">TINMOM Postmortem</h1>
			<p class="info">I have never written a postmortem before so we will see how this goes. I'm a programmer not a writer.</p>
			<p class="stuff">What I learned</p>
			<p class="info">While making TINMOM, I learned how important it is to have a clear direction for the game you are making. I knew from the start that it had to be an engaging endless game where all you can do is beam things up. Because I had such a clear idea of what I wanted to make I could judge new additions to the game based on how well they help that core idea. All the constraints posed by the game jam helped me focus on a core idea. For future games, I now know deliberately designing around a specific core idea can make the game stronger. My previous games were a bit unfocused. Some I had a strong idea of what I wanted to be but I never made decisions as deliberately as with TINMOM.</p>
			<p class="info">TINMOM is a deliberately simple game and that is probably the only reason why I finished it. All the games I have released before TINMOM were made in less than 2 weeks. Most of them in 48 hours. Between Emordnilap and Brain-Dead is about a 2.5 year gap. During that time I was still making games, but I never got any to the point of completion. It wasn’t until I decided to enter another game jam with Emordnilap that I finally released something again. Clearly I have a problem with project scope and knowing when to stop. I stumbled upon a good solution to that problem while making TINMOM. Making one game a week. During the first few days working on TINMOM, I would take breaks from programming to watch random game design talks mostly from GDC. One of those was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O9Q8OVWrFA" class="wordlink">Game a Week: Teaching Students to Prototype</a> by Douglas Wilson and Bennett Foddy about their “game a week” way of teaching a game design class. The strict deadline from the process would force me to release a game regardless of how done it is. Making TINMOM was like making 1 game a week except slighter longer. The strict deadline allowed me to keep the TINMOM scope very small which is what I need for future games I make. I learned a lot about game making just from finishing TINMOM. I think I need more learning experiences like TINMOM. So I want to try out making one game a week. Hopefully I learn a lot from the process.</p>
			<p class="stuff">What went wrong.</p>
			<p class="info">I was a bit too apprehensive to add new things to TINMOM. I was not sure if adding to the game would just make it bloated or if it would add to the experience. Since the game was supposed to be simple, not adding to it didn’t hurt the experience, but I think there was more I could have done with the tractor beam mechanic. I should have spent more time exploring the mechanic to see what else would improve the core of the game. </p>
			<p class="stuff">How it was made.</p>
			<p class="info">This game was made for the Opera GX Game Jam. The point of the jam was to make the “No Internet” game for the Opera GX browser. Such as the Google Dinosaur game or the surfing skifree reskin for Edge (I didn’t even know this existed until the game jam). I wasn’t originally going to join the jam but the chance of having my game be the “No Internet” game seemed super cool. So the day before the jam I decided to join and see what happens. As a result, I made my favorite game so far. I doubt it will win but I’m super happy with what I made. I also realized I like making arcade style games a lot.</p>
			<p class="info">I stayed up late to see the theme revealed live. The theme was UFO. My plan was to come up with an idea in my sleep. As I was laying down in bed, I thought about what was unique with a UFO that I could only do with a UFO theme. It wasn’t too long until my mind went to the tractor beam that UFOs usually have in pop culture. Picking things up with the tractor beam seemed like the most unique UFO mechanic. My first idea was to make a puzzle game with the beam. Something along the lines of Tetris except you pick up blocks instead of dropping them. I never fleshed the idea out too far. I started to make a prototype of it and within 20 minutes had a UFO with a beam that could pick up cows. A puzzle game like tetris didn’t really seem to match with the feel of the Google dinosaur game. I knew I needed to do something with the tractor beam so I went back to the drawing board. I had the start of something I just needed to figure out the rest of the puzzle.</p>
			<p class="info">I needed more inspiration for the game. So I browsed twitter to see what other people were doing for the Opera GX game jam. I saw a GIF of someone’s game where they had a tank shooting a bullet at a UFO in some endless runner. If I wasn’t doing a puzzle game then clearly the UFO needed an enemy. A tank shooting at the UFO was the next puzzle piece to my cow sucking up simulator. </p>
			<p class="info">A few weeks before the game jam, I had bought Derek Yu’s <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu" class="wordlink">Spelunky book</a>. Near the beginning of the book he mentions that Spelunky was inspired by early roguelikes such as Nethack. The massive “possibility space” and the strict rule set everything in the game follows in particular that inspired Spelunky stuck out to me as very interesting. The idea that everything interacted with each other was another puzzle piece to the UFO game. Next, I had been playing Downwell again in the month preceding the game jam. Downwell is of course a master in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5C1Uj7jJCg" class="wordlink">dual-purpose design</a> and the idea of having one thing do many things seemed perfect for a simple endless game. This dual-purpose design is the penultimate puzzle piece to making TINMOM. The final piece to the puzzle is the recently defunct Vlambeer game studio. During my game design talk marathon that I mentioned earlier, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJdEqssNZ-U" class="wordlink">The art of screenshake</a> by Jan Willem Nijman who was half of Vlambeer. The talk is about what makes a game feel fun to play. The Opera GX game jam page specifically says “most engaging HTML5 game.” The more fun the game feels to play the more engaging it should be. Then I watched some game design talks by the other half of Vlambeer, Rami Ismail, and I stumbled upon a clip from one of his talks about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPyYZjCQ0Is" class="wordlink">4:44</a> rule. A line from it particularly stuck out to me, “good design isn’t when you can’t add things anymore. A good design is when you can’t take anything away anymore without it breaking.” Anytime I felt like adding more to the game I thought back to the quote and asked if it was really necessary. Most of the time it was not.</p>
			<p class="info">Now that I had the puzzle pieces, I needed to assemble it into a complete fun game. I added in a tank enemy that shot missiles at the UFO. The game now had 4 essential elements (UFO, cow, missile, tank) and if I removed any of them the game would break. I made a decision then to not add anything more until what I had was fun. The game needed to be easy to understand for anyone who stumbles upon it when the internet goes out so I constrained the controls to three options. Left, right, and tractor beam. The game needed some way of attacking the tanks but adding a gun to the UFO would require an extra button violating the self-imposed constraints. So using the same philosophy as Downwell’s dual purpose design the tractor beam would have to do as much as possible. The tractor beam was going to be the only way the player could interact with the world. How would a tractor beam destroy tanks? By attracting them obviously. Not much else it can do. Then I thought back to the interactions described in the Spelunky book and how everything interacts with everything. I decided then that all the elements of the game would interact with each other. If the UFO tractor beam attracts cows then it should attract everything else. So now the beam could pick up tanks and missiles. If missiles could blow up the UFO then it should blow up tanks and other missiles. Originally I also had cows blow up when hit by missiles but due to the large quantity of cows it felt off to me. So I removed it and made it so the cows did not interact with anything. The end result was an interesting game of interactions as the player sucked up cows, missiles, and tanks then dropped the latter 2 on each other causing mass explosions. I thought it was incredibly fun to just pick things up and drop them. So I added some game feel fun stuff to make it feel even better to play as described in JW’s talk. I added sound effects then went bonkers with screenshake and added it to everything. Explosions? Screenshake. Dropping tanks? Screenshake. Dropping cows? Screenshake. Pressing the tractor beam button? Screenshake. I tried to keep any screenshake subtle with the exception of explosions. The game now felt way better to play.</p>
			<p class="info">I needed to make sure it wasn’t all in my head and the game was actually fun. I started showing it to my friends and family. Everyone kept saying it was super fun and addicting. One of my friends compared it specifically to the Google Dinosaur game without knowing that I was trying to make a “No Internet” game. My attempt at a “No Internet” game reminded them of the original one? Clearly I was doing something right. I wanted to know what I was doing wrong though. So I asked everyone if they hated anything about it. No one could come up with anything they disliked about playing it. My sample size of play testers was very small so they easily could be missing something that could be improved. The core gameplay of picking up stuff and dropping them was super fun to everyone who playtested it, so I moved forward under the assumption that everyone in the world would find it fun too. I spent most of the next two weeks polishing the game and enhancing the game feel until there was no more feeling to wring out of pressing buttons. The end result is the TINMOM that can be played on gamejolt</p>
