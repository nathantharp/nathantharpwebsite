			<p class="intro">A chronological list of video games I had some part in making.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://tharp.itch.io/shield-hero" class="gamelink">Shield Hero</a> - August 30, 2021</p>
			<p class="info">A short rogue-like about throwing a shield.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://tharp.itch.io/roly-poly-game" class="gamelink">Roly Poly Game</a> - August 22, 2021</p>
			<p class="info">Roly poly rolls around into enemies. small top down rogue-like. First game in my make one game a week challenge. Forgot to make an ending, so it ends when you die.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/tinmom/637475" class="gamelink">TINMOM</a> - August 12, 2021</p>
			<p class="info">UFO uses tractor beam to collect cows and deflect missiles at tanks. Fun arcade endless game. <a href="https://beefcliff.tumblr.com/" class="gamelink">Beefcliff</a> made the lovely art and some sound effects. I am very happy with this game.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://tharp.itch.io/polygone" class="gamelink">Polygone</a> - July 23, 2021</p>
			<p class="info">Polygone is a short top-down shooter bullet hell. This is the first game I released under my real name, Nathan Tharp. I made this quickly in half a day for a random game jam I found on itch.io as a chance to finally sit down and release a game. It is not very polished or balanced because I made it to remind myself to release games. As you might notice there is a year gap between this game and the last. Hopefully this game is the start of me actually finishing games.
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://gm48.net/game/1661/emordnilap" class="gamelink">Emordnilap</a> - July 19, 2020</p>
			<p class="info">Control 2 characters at the same time in a platformer. Made for the 35th gm48 game jam. I did the programming and level design. My friend, Amhacaoty, made the lovely art and music. The theme was two sides so I split the game in half and made two platformers on both sides. Not a very inventive idea but it was fun to make. My favorite part is the last level as it was a bit more of a creative use of the theme than the rest of the game. It definitely needed more polish but the game is still fun. I am very happy with how this turned out.</p>
			<p class="gap">HUGE GAP IN TIME WITH MANY UNFINISHED GAMES</p>
			<p class="intro">The games below were made during my first year as a game developer.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://radicalest.itch.io/brain-dead" class="gamelink">Brain-Dead</a> - December 5, 2017</p>
			<p class="info">A top-down shooter and tower defense of shorts. Technically made for Ludum Dare 40 but it doesn't do anything interesting related to the theme. I completely forgot that I made it for Ludum Dare until I started compiling this list of games years later. A disappointing end to the many released games of 2017. Not polished and very unbalanced. I made it to get a game out while in a funk of working on games for too long then abandoning them. The tower defense building mechanic is interesting but shallow. Mostly bad.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://gm48.net/game/661/sacrifight" class="gamelink">Sacrifight</a> - July 16, 2017</p>
			<p class="info">A very simple 2d fighting game. Made for the 23rd gm48 game jam. I did the programming. My friend, Amhacaoty, made the lovely art and sounds. The theme for the game jam was sacrifice and I immediately thought of the pun combination of fight and sacrifice. The entire game was made based on that pun. I like how the game turned out. For my skill level at the time this game was good. Its a simple fun little game. </p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://gm48.net/game/555/sewer-descend" class="gamelink">Sewer Descend</a> - April 16, 2017</p>
			<p class="info">You descend into a sewer and clean it. Made for the 22nd gm48 game jam. The game jam theme was descend. The game is not very fun. Would not recommend playing it. At the time of making it I didn't understand what made good games good, and I still don't but I'm getting there. For example, the game has a shop because I played a good game that had a shop in it. I think the game could have been something good if I had more experience.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://radicalest.itch.io/clickmon" class="gamelink">Clickmon</a> - April 14, 2017</p>
			<p class="info">Small idle clicker game where you catch the monsters you click on to defeat. I made this in about a day based on a game I made in Scratch for school. It's eh but it was just a fun 1 day prototype to see if I could program an idle clicker.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://radicalest.itch.io/milkman-of-the-milky-way" class="gamelink">Milkman of the Milkyway</a> - January 21, 2017</p>
			<p class="info">Play as the milkman for the milkyway galaxy. Made for My First Game Jam: Winter as it was my first game jam. This game was made towards the beginning of my game making journey. This game holds a special place in my heart as my first game jam game. I don't think its good or fun. Not too bad for my first game jam. You probably shouldn't play it though.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://radicalest.itch.io/vermis" class="gamelink">Vermis</a> - November 6, 2016</p>
			<p class="info">A short small platformer about a worm. Vermis is Latin for worm according to Google Translate. This game was made while I was learning how to make games in Gamemaker: Studio. I wanted to see if I could make a platformer and this game was the result. I could infact make a platformer.</p>
			<p class="stuff"><a href="https://radicalest.itch.io/blob-blobbers" class="gamelink">Blob Blobbers</a> - July 25, 2016</p>
			<p class="info">My first publicly released video game. A top down shooter where a blob shoots other blobs to protect the big blob. The game is very simple but for a first game its not bad.</p>
